Millennials, young adults between the ages of 18 and 25, face new and daunting challenges. Uncertainty, confusion, a fragile economy, and rising personal debt occasion understandable anxiety. Is this the right time in life to think long and hard about questions of faith, meaning, and purpose?

_In many ways, this is exactly the right time to engage these questions._

The cover story in the January/February issue of Christianity Today, ["Stop Worrying about the Millennials"][0] raises timely observations about the faith formation of emerging adults. Andy Root captures the spirit of much of this, saying:

> Like some reverse Paul Revere, many ride through the fiber optics of the Internet and into church basements shouting, "The millennials are leaving! Watch out for the rise of the nones!"

Andy Root is right to indicate that much of this anxiety is less about the legitimate concerns and fears of millennials than it is the lack of nerve among some mainline and evangelical church leaders. Are we really worried _for_ millennials, or worried _about_ what their anxieties might mean for our future? Are we nervous that if they leave, our churches will become increasingly empty and irrelevant, or are we concerned _with_ their spiritual development and life with God?

Truly caring for 18-25-year-olds demands that we resist the temptation to re-invent the church and, instead, focus upon discipleship. Helping them to navigate this crucial period of life well is an honorable and deeply Christian form of ministry. If we do _this_ well, they will inevitably see the place that the church can play in their ongoing growth and formation.

We owe Andy Root a considerable debt in reminding us how important ministry to children and youth was to the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

Note, as helpful as the CT article is, a much fuller treatment of Root's commendable work can be found [here][1], or better yet, his recently published book with Baker Academic: _Bonhoeffer as Youth Worker_.

Root reminds us that in 1933 Bonhoeffer wrote "Eight Theses on the Youth Work of the Church", the first of which runs like this:

> Since the days of the youth movement, church youth work has often lacked that element of Christian sobriety that alone might enable it to recognize that the spirit of youth is not the Holy Spirit and that the future of the church is not youth itself but rather the Lord Jesus Christ alone. It is the task of youth not to reshape the church, but rather to listen to the Word of God; it is the task of the church not to capture the youth, but to teach and proclaim the Word of God.

How very helpful it is to have such a clear expression of the responsibilities facing both youth (Millennials) and the church. Bonhoeffer is entirely right to say that youth should not seek to "reshape the church" but instead, should _listen_ to the Word of God. At the same time, the church's responsibility is not to try to "capture the youth" but to _teach_ and _proclaim_ the Word of God. As it should be, the only true basis of lasting hope is the living and transformative presence of the divine Word.

If there is any real ground for anxiety vis-a-vis the Millennials, it should be this: have we busied ourselves with the task of seeking to "capture" their attention and, in the process, actually failed to teach and proclaim the Word of God?
