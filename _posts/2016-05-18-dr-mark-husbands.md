Seeking to evoke curiosity in the intellectual coherence of the Christian faith, my administrative work, scholarship, teaching and lectures aim to represent a clear, winsome, and intellectually vibrant voice for a robust and culturally relevant public witness. My primary scholarship is focused upon the moral theology of Karl Barth, with a secondary interest in the doctrine of reconciliation, political theology and world Christianity.

I am the Vice-President for Academic Affairs at [Northwestern College][0] where I have the privilege of Northwestern College's vital commitment to being a Christian liberal arts college that is intellectually strong, spiritually vibrant and fully engaged in an evangelical commitment to the cultural renewal of all things in Christ. It is an honor to lead undergraduate and graduate programs that are significant public expressions of the integration of faith and work carried out in joyful and lasting service to the kingdom of GodPrior to joining Northwestern College I held the Leonard and Marjorie Maas Chair of Reformed Theology at Hope College. In 2013, I was named a Fellow of the Center for Ministry Studies. In 2012, I was appointed the founding Director of the Emmaus Scholars Program, an innovative one-year academic/residential/intentional Christian community focused upon integral mission, calling, justice, spiritual formation, and reconciliation. From 2001-2007, I held a faculty position at Wheaton College (IL) teaching theology, directing its annual Theology Conference and offered leadership to key international and domestic experiential learning programs (the HNGR --- Human Needs and Global Resources Program, and Wheaton's Outdoor Center for Leadership Development /Honey Rock Camp). Prior to teaching at Wheaton College, I served as the Director of Summer School and Extension Studies and Professor of Theology at Tyndale Seminary in Toronto.

I earned an undergraduate degree from York University (Toronto) in Religious Studies. Went on to earn a Masters of Religion degree in philosophical theology at Wycliffe College (University of Toronto) where I wrote a master's thesis on the language philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, and launched an academic journal called _Prolegomena_. At the University of St. Michael's College (University of Toronto), I carried out doctoral work under the supervision of one of the world's leading Reformed theologians and Barth scholars, Professor John Webster (formerly the Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Oxford, now Professor of Theology at St. Andrews University) and completed a dissertation on Barth's moral theology and actualist-ontology.
